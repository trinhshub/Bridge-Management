During my masters program, I work with other researchers to complete the *10-Year Management Plan* sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). My task is developing an excel-based tool for bridge engineers to compute bridge asset values on individual and network levels. This project requires conducting research related to bridge asset valuation, state-of-the-art bridge management practice, and bridge deterioration modeling.

**Tool Platform:** Excel VBA

**Tool Features:**

 ★ Estimating crash rates of bridges using regression and historical crash data from TxDOT's CRIS Database
 
 ★ Computing bridge values using various traditional valuation models
 
 ★ Computing bridge values using bridge utilities
 
 ★ Comparing investment alternatives
 
 ★ Predicting future performance
