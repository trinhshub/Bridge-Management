During my masters program, I worked on a part of the 10-Year Management Plan sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). My task is developing an excel-based tool to compute bridge asset values on individual and network level. This project requires conducting research related to bridge asset valuation, state-of-the-art bridge management practice, and bridge deterioration modeling. 

**Features of the tool**

 ★ Estimating crash rates of bridges using regression and historical crash data from TxDOT's CRIS Database
 
 ★ Computing bridge values using various traditional valuation models
 
 ★ Computing bridge values using bridge utilities
 
 ★ Comparing investment alternatives
 
 ★ Predicting future performance
