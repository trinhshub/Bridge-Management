During my masters program, I worked on a part of the 10-Year Management Plan sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). I was tasked with developing an excel-based tool to compute bridge asset values on individual and network level. This project requires conducting research related to bridge asset valuation, management practice, and performance prediction. 

Some features of the tool:
  - Estimating crash rates of bridges using regression and historical crash data from TxDOT's CRIS Database
  - Computing bridge values using various traditional valuation models
  - Computing bridge values using bridge utilities
  - Comparing investment alternatives
  - Predicting future performance
